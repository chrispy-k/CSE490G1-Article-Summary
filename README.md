# CSE490G1-Article-Summary

## Abstract
Everyday we come across abundant amount of texts. From short Twitter posts to news articles, there are so many texts getting generated every day. In fact, according to Chartbeat, 92,000 articles get generated each day. Now, if we include things like Twitter posts, Facebook posts, etc, the number is going to be even bigger. We definitely cannot read them all, and reading only the ones that interest us will most likely be impossible as well. But, what if we can summarize those texts to few sentences? We can definitely manage more texts, and read some other texts that we may never have read because we did not have time

## Introduction

In this section the problem you are working on. Maybe talk about why you thought it was interesting. Or why you think it needs to get solved.

You may also want to say a little bit here about what you did. Not too much though. Don't give the whole game away.

## Related Work

Other people are out there doing things. What did they do? Was it good? Was it bad? Talk about it here.

## Approach

How did you decide to solve the problem? What network architecture did you use? What data? Lots of details here about all the things you did. This section describes almost your whole project.

Figures are good here. Maybe you present your network architecture or show some example data points?

## Results

How did you evaluate your approach? How well did you do? What are you comparing to? Maybe you want ablation studies or comparisons of different methods.

You may want some qualitative results and quantitative results. Example images/text/whatever are good. Charts are also good. Maybe loss curves or AUC charts. Whatever makes sense for your evaluation.

## Discussion

You can talk about your results and the stuff you've learned here if you want. Or discuss other things. Really whatever you want, it's your project.
